       " \"You selectively picked BJP politicians . Idk if you even stay in India or not - But homophobia isnt a left or right divide that you like to make it out as to be , Homophobia is All Partisan in India . Did you forget , the then Congress Health minister Gulam Nabi Azad called Homosexuality a mental Disorder ? ; Arent these the messiah you guys want to vote to power to ?\\n\\nPoliticians are not the guardians of Hinduism , I defintely agree , BJP has nothing to do with religion , its vote bank politics . India is in terms with Sub sharaan African nations in terms of GDP per capita , which was ruled by victorian era laws for 2 centuries and Islamic laws before that , Homophobia isnt a Hinduism oriented discussion. If you look at Countries with Similar percapita Incomes , Say even bangladesh You might really understand how bad Its to be ruled by far rights or Abrahamic religions . \\n\\nKerala isnt a progressive state because they vote Left or that the churches there are  Ultra progressive , If you look back In History Travancore state was always way ahead of India in terms of Literacy , In 1947 Literacy of KL was 47 percent of that opposed to national average of 16 percent . It was the King of Travancore who reformed Kerala, who was the head of shri Padhmaswamy temple. \\n\\neven in countries where it does, most of them already have marriage equality. - Absolute garbage , equal amount of Christians stay in Africa and South America as to in western nations . Countries where , Churches do play a role like Jamica or Russia are on par with Islamic nations in their treatment of Homosexual people . The countries You like to sugar coat are in Western Europe with a primararly Atheistic Population . So the church isnt doing any favours to Gay people . Kerelas Bishop council clearly stated it had not changed its Homophobic position -  [https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kerala-bishops-council-no-change-in-church-stand-pope-didnt-justify-same-sex-marriage-6844896/](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kerala-bishops-council-no-change-in-church-stand-pope-didnt-justify-same-sex-marriage-6844896/) .

       " 'I will continue to \"selectively\" pick BJP politicians until they are in power. Because its their opinions that matter. Why do people assume that if someone hates BJP, they automatically love Congress? Ghulam Nabi Azad made a statement, but then there is also Shashi Tharoor from the same party who has tried to push same-sex marriage bill multiple times through the parliament. Congress is not a great party either but they tend not to vehemently oppose minority rights and make toxic hatred filled comments regarding that. Show me one BJP politician who has been supportive of lgbtq rights (let alone marriage).\\n\\nHere is the official response of the Yogi govt that you people have been defending:\\nhttps://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/apr/14/up-govt-opposes-same-sex-marriage-allahabad-hc-rejects-plea-of-lesbian-couplenbsp-2442014.amp\\n\\nHere is the response of Modi govt on the same:\\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/same-sex-marriages-will-cause-havoc-central-govt-tells-hc/article33936176.ece/amp/\\n\\nStop comparing India which is a secular county to Islamic regressive countries to make it look better. The fact is its not better given how its treats its minorities. Instead of comparing to Bangladesh and Pakistan, why not compare to US or Canada? Its people like you who believe India to be the greatest country in the world yet you compare it to the worst ones to feel good about it.\\n\\nSome countries where churches play role have anti-lgbtq policies, but majority of them don\\'t. US is still a heavily religious country but they still got marriage equality codified. I live in Germany where the govt collects church tax on behalf of the church and the church has so much power that it manages to keep shops and markets shut on Sundays. Around 60-70% of Germans are religious. But the politicians do not give a shit when it comes to equal rights. Italy doesn\\'t give a shit either, even though the Pope literally lives there.\\n\\nRSS has made some flip-flop comments about lgbtq rights over the years. But it doesn\\'t matter what RSS thinks or what the Churches think. What matters is what the party in power thinks. And they have made it abundantly clear through official court replies, even if you ignore the individual statements.\\n\\nI do not live in India anymore. And I understand and appreciate my privilege that I was able to leave. It was hard work and it does not mean that I do not love my country and its hard to watch how it goes down in every social indicators while politicians make regressive statements especially from the ruling party. And it also hurts that a bunch of people here ready up in arms to defend their political gurus even at the cost of their own rights and liberties.',\n",
       " \"Ill start with some major examples -\\n\\n1)Arun jaitley the then finance minister supported decriminalisation of same sex relationships .\\n\\n2) Santosh Gangwar from Bareily UP supported shashi tharoors bill for same sex marriages.\\n\\n3) Jagdambika Pal BJP - Provided bill to make LGBT and Trans folks oppurtunities in Armed forces, In 2018.\\n\\nthere are many Such MP's and cabinet ministers from BJP you will find on the PinkList easily , If you choose not to create a narrative.\\n\\nI donot compare it with canada , because we share no history , Culture , religion , race , heck not even continents with Canada or US. Percapita Income of Canada is almost 20 times that of India , the reason to compare it with Pakistan and Bangladesh is due to shared history , culture , languages , race except religion. If you read a little perhaps , Bangladesh is not an Islamic nation , Bangladesh is a secular nation as per 1972 constitution they adapted.  I donot believe India is the Greatest country on the Planet earth , What I do believe is India does better than most countries in its arena who share similar demographics , cultures , Standard of living with ours . Has Canada or US stayed under British or Islamic colonialisation like India? Its like comparing a person in a wheel chair and a marathon runner about who can run longer .\\n\\nDo you have any sources for your claim , Or do you make them from your personal Biases  ?\\n\\n60 percent of germans believe religion does not play an role in their life and 45 percent are atheists , German society is not christian they are atheistic - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion\\\\_in\\\\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_Germany)\\n\\nUSA is not Religious , Some states of US are religious .

I could say the literal same about you , Can I not ? So deluded by hatred for Hindus , that calling out gay people voting for BJP is alright?\\n\\nLmao , sure . I understand . Ive seen many Indian gay guys in US , who like to bad mouth India so that they can come out as progressive and \\\\*Acceptable\\\\* in front of American masters and like to take a dunk on Indians in India , as if we have taliban style stoning here in India . I dont mind that . Ill add , Some people cant digest , Queer people can have other personality trait than just being queer , Yes being Gay ,  I want gay rights but I definietly do want a stable economy , Inflation rates , Capitalistic growth .\"]"
